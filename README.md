  <h2>What is FLL?</h2>

  <p>The FIRST LEGO League Challenge Robotics Tournament challenges students from 9 to 16 years old to seek solutions for the everyday life of modern society. The themes are different each season â€“ in 2020, for example, they were challenged to rethink spaces for exercises, competitions and games.

  Young people, led by two adults, need to work in harmony based on values such as respect, mutual gain and friendly competition. Following specific rules specifically for each season, they build patterns based on LEGO Mindstorm technology, which must be programmed to fulfill a series of missions.</p>
